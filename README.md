<h1>DCN - Data Communication & Networking Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a model of networking keeping accordance with College.The network topology used is a Hybrid- Topology of tree and bus.
<br />

## â†’Properties of Model
- It is infinitely expand-able and DHCP pools are used to assign Ip address
- Firewalls and network security such as passwords on all wireless devices help ensure any breach.
- RIP is used as routing protocol which helps to add new networks easily
- Websites for Students, faculty, Directorate are designed in a user-friendly way
